To run this bundle, please add your own source file<code>data/ACTWorkKeys_sample_anonymized_file.csv</code> or use the sample files (<code>data/sample_anonymized_file2017.csv</code> or <code>data/sample_anonymized_file2022.csv</code>).

This bundle works with ACTWorkKeys files in the format provided by the assessment vendor. Please note that the structure of these files may vary depending on the year. For example, the 2022 ACT WorkKeys files follow a different format than those used in previous years. This bundle includes support for both formats and adjusts its processing logic based on the test year.

For details about the mapping look at the [mapping document](./mapping.md) found here.

## CLI Parameters

### Required
- **OUTPUT_DIR**: Where output files will be written.
- **INPUT_FILE**: The assessment file to be mapped
- **STUDENT_ID_NAME**: Which column to use as the Ed-Fi `studentUniqueId`. Can be this column in the assessment file: `Examinee ID` or `stateid` when the bundle is run directly. Otherwise leave the default value `edFi_studentUniqueID`. 
- **POSSIBLE_STUDENT_ID_COLUMNS**: This should contain all the possible native student id columns in the assessment file (e.g., `Examinee ID` for 2022 and `stateid` for previous years). 
### Optional
- **DESCRIPTOR_NAMESPACE**: This should be the default namespace for descriptors such as ResultDatatypeTypeDescriptor. The default value is: uri://ed-fi.org.
- **SCHOOL_YEAR**: The school year of the assessment file (structure of '2022' or '2017', etc).

### Examples

Run the following command:
```bash
earthmover run -c ./earthmover.yaml -p '{
  "INPUT_FILE": "path/to/ACTWorkKeys_sample_anonymized_file.csv",
  "OUTPUT_DIR": "./output",
  "STUDENT_ID_NAME": "Examinee ID",
  "SCHOOL_YEAR" : "2022"
}'
```

Once you have inspected the output JSONL for issues, check the settings in lightbeam.yaml and transmit them to your Ed-Fi API with:

```bash
lightbeam validate+send -c ./lightbeam.yaml -p '{
  "DATA_DIR": "./output/",
  "API_YEAR": "yourAPIYear",
  "BASE_URL": "yourURL",
  "EDFI_API_CLIENT_ID": "yourID",
  "EDFI_API_CLIENT_SECRET": "yourSecret"
}'
```
