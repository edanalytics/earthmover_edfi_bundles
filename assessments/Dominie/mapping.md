## Reasoning
The Dominie Reading and Writing Assessment is designed to provide a comprehensive, formative evaluation of early literacy skills for students in kindergarten through third grade. Its purpose is to guide instruction and intervention by assessing foundational components of reading and writing, including phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, comprehension, vocabulary, spelling, and writing conventions. The assessmentâ€™s portfolio-based format allows educators to capture individual student progress across multiple domains, inform instructional decisions, and support differentiated learning based on student needs.
