## Assessments Score Method Descriptors
Each ObjectiveAssessment corresponds to a particular literacy skill. When multiple scoring methods are available for the same skill, such as a raw score and a stanine score, they are represented as separate score entries under the same ObjectiveAssessment.
 - Raw Score: string
 - Percent: decimal
 - Stanine: Standard nine-point scale scores for norm-referenced interpretation (integer)
 - Rubric?: decimal

## Reasoning
The Dominie Reading and Writing Assessment is designed to provide a comprehensive, formative evaluation of early literacy skills for students in kindergarten through third grade. Its purpose is to guide instruction and intervention by assessing foundational components of reading and writing, including phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, comprehension, vocabulary, spelling, and writing conventions. The assessmentâ€™s portfolio-based format allows educators to capture individual student progress across multiple domains, inform instructional decisions, and support differentiated learning based on student needs.
